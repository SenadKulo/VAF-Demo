Welcome to the Vision Automation Framework (VAF) Demo Projectâ€”a comprehensive demonstration of modern test automation practices. This repository serves as a practical guide to showcase the capabilities and ease of use offered by VAF.

Overview:

Vision Automation Framework (VAF) is designed to make test automation accessible, readable, and efficient. It introduces a unique 'fluent' method syntax that enhances the readability of automation scripts, making them intuitive and easy to maintain.

Key Features:

-Fluent Method Syntax: VAF leverages a 'fluent' method syntax, mirroring natural language. This not only makes the code more readable but also enhances the overall expressiveness of automation scripts.

-Readability Amplification: The framework optimizes code readability, resulting in test scripts that are not just functional but also coherent, organized, and easily comprehensible.

-Simplified Maintenance: Addressing the challenge of complex code structures, VAF minimizes the effort required to maintain automated test suites. Its streamlined architecture promotes long-term sustainability.

We welcome contributions! Feel free to raise issues, propose enhancements, or submit pull requests. Together, let's shape the future of automation testing.

Happy Testing!
